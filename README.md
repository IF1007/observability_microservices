# observability_microservices
A tool to provide multi layer observability to any microservices based application

Team: Gabriel Henrique, Fagner Fernandes.

Our goal is to provide a tool that could be easily integrated to any microservices based application to provide observability.
With this approach, we can monitor the nodes, the clusters and the hole application, thus preventing failures and major errors.

To Compose our Tool, we use the ones presented below:

Prometheus - www.prometheus.io
Grafana - www.grafana.com
Jaeger - www.jaegertracing.io
Kiali - www.kiali.io
Istio - www.istio.io
